# elasticsearch-head-chrome-bearer-auth
Chrome Extension containing the ElasticSearch Head application which supports both bearer and basic authentication.

### Synopsis

Chrome Extension containing the excellent [ElasticSearch Head](https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head) application.

### Motivation

This is created because I wanted to validate each request to elasticsearch using Bearer scheme instead of Basic authentication scheme. Forked from repo of TravisTX/elasticsearch-head-chrome
